1.  Introduction

   Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS, [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture])
   describe interactions between well-defined architectural constituents
   in support of Relying Parties that require an understanding about the
   trustworthiness of a remote peer.  The identity of an Attester and
   its corresponding Attesting Environments play a vital role in RATS.
   A common way to refer to such an identity is the Authentication
   Secret ID as defined in the Reference Interaction Models for RATS
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models].  The fact that every
   Attesting Environment can be uniquely identified in the context of
   the RATS architecture is not suitable for every application of remote
   attestation.  Additional issues may arise when Personally
   identifiable information (PII) -- whether obfuscated or in clear text
   -- are included in attestation Evidence or even corresponding
   Attestation Results.  This document illustrates how Direct Anonymous
   Attestation (DAA) can mitigate the issue of uniquely
   (re-)identifiable Attesting Environments.  To accomplish that goal, a
   new RATS role -- the DAA Issuer -- is introduced and its duties as
   well as its interactions with other RATS roles are specified.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following set of terms, roles, and concepts as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]: Attester, Verifier, Relying
   Party, Conceptual Message, Evidence, Attestation Result, Attesting
   Environment.  The role of Endorser, also defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture], needs to be adapted and details are
   given below.

   Additionally, this document uses and adapts, as necessary, the
   following concepts and information elements as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models]: Attester Identity,
   Authentication Secret, Authentication Secret ID

   A PKIX Certificate is an X.509v3 format certificate as specified by
   [RFC5280].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Direct Anonymous Attestation

   In [DAA], two protocols as described in [DAA] are illustrated: the
   Join Protocol and the DAA-Signing Protocol.  This Section specifies
   the mapping of the protocol entity DAA Issuer described in [DAA] as
   an actor in the Join Protocol as well as an actor in the
   corresponding DAA-Signing Protocol to roles specified in the RATS
   Architecture.

   In the Join Protocol, the RATS roles Verifier and associated Relying
   Party roles are taking the protocol entity DAA Issuer.  The mapping
   is illustrated in Figure Figure 1.

          Figure 1: RATS Architecture for the Join Protocol

   The Join Protocol is essentially an enrollment protocol that consumes
   Evidence from the Attester (therefore the mapping to the Verifier
   role).  Appraisal Policies for Evidence specifically dedicated to
   that appraisal procedure are used to decide whether to issue a DAA
   credential to an Attester or not.

   In the DAA-Signing Protocol, the RATS role Endorser is then taken on
   by the DAA Issuer protocol entity.  The mapping is illustrated in
   Figure Figure 2.

       Figure 2: RATS Architecture for the DAA-Signing Protocol

   The DAA Issuer acts as the Endorser for the Group Public Key that is
   used by the Verifier for the appraisal of evidence of anonymized
   Attesters that use the DAA credentials and associated key material to
   produce Evidence.

   In consequence, DAA provides a signature scheme that allows the
   privacy of users that are associated with an Attester (e.g. its
   owner) to be maintained.  Essentially, DAA can be seen as a group
   signature scheme with the feature that given a DAA signature no-one
   can find out who the signer is, i.e., the anonymity is not revocable.
   To be able to sign anonymously, an Attester has to obtain a
   credential from a DAA Issuer.  The DAA Issuer uses a private/public
   key pair to generate credentials for a group of Attesters and makes
   the public key (in the form of a public key certificate) available to
   the verifier in order to enable them to validate the Evidence
   received.

   In order to support these DAA signatures, the DAA Issuer MUST
   associate a single key pair with a group of Attesters and use the
   same key pair when creating the credentials for all of the Attesters
   in this group.  The DAA Issuer’s group public key certificate
   replaces the individual Attester Identity documents during
   authenticity validation as a part of the appraisal of Evidence
   conducted by a verifier.  This is in contrast to intuition that there
   has to be a unique Attester Identity per device.

   For DAA, the role of the Endorser is essentially the same, but they
   now provide Attester endorsement documents to the DAA Issuer rather
   than directly to the verifier.  These Attester endorsement documents
   enable the Attester to obtain a credential from the DAA Issuer.

4.  DAA changes to the RATS Architecture

   In order to enable the use of DAA, a new conceptual message, the
   Credential Request, is defined and a new role, the DAA Issuer role,
   is added to the roles defined in the RATS Architecture.

   Credential Request:  An Attester sends a Credential Request to the
      DAA Issuer to obtain a credential.  This request contains
      information about the DAA key that the Attester will use to create
      evidence and, together with Attester endorsement information that
      is provided by the Endorser, to confirm that the request came from
      a valid Attester.

   DAA Issuer:  A RATS role that offers zero-knowledge proofs based on
      public-key certificates used for a group of Attesters (Group
      Public Keys) [DAA].  How this group of Attesters is defined is not
      specified here, but the group must be large enough for the
      necessary anonymity to be assured.

   Effectively, these certificates share the semantics of Endorsements,
   with the following exceptions:

   *  Upon receiving a Credential Request from an Attester, the
      associated group private key is used by the DAA Issuer to provide
      the Attester with a credential that it can use to convince the
      Verifier that its Evidence is valid.  To keep their anonymity, the
      Attester randomises this credential each time that it is used.
      Although the DAA Issuer knows the Attester Identity and can
      associate this with the credential issued, randomisation ensures
      that the Attester's identity cannot be revealed to anyone,
      including the DAA Issuer.

   *  The Verifier can use the DAA Issuer's group public key
      certificate, together with the randomised credential from the
      Attester, to confirm that the Evidence comes from a valid Attester
      without revealing the Attester's identity.

   *  A credential is conveyed from a DAA Issuer to an Attester in
      combination with the conveyance of the group public key
      certificate from DAA Issuer to Verifier.

5.  Additions to Remote Attestation principles

   In order to ensure an appropriate conveyance of Evidence via
   interaction models in general, the following prerequisite considering
   Attester Identity MUST be in place to support the implementation of
   interaction models.

   Attestation Evidence Authenticity:  Attestation Evidence MUST be
      correct and authentic.

      In order to provide proofs of authenticity, Attestation Evidence
      SHOULD be cryptographically associated with an identity document
      that is a randomised DAA credential.

   The following information elements define extensions for
   corresponding information elements defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models], which are vital to all
   types of reference interaction models.  Varying from solution to
   solution, generic information elements can be either included in the
   scope of protocol messages (instantiating Conceptual Messages defined
   by the RATS architecture) or can be included in additional protocol
   parameters of protocols that facilitate the conveyance of RATS
   Conceptual Messages.  Ultimately, the following information elements
   are required by any kind of scalable remote attestation procedure
   using DAA with one of RATS's reference interaction models.

   Attester Identity ('attesterIdentity'):  _mandatory_

      In DAA, the Attester's identity is not revealed to the verifier.
      The Attester is issued with a credential by the DAA Issuer that is
      randomised and then used to anonymously confirm the validity of
      their evidence.  The evidence is verified using the DAA Issuer’s
      group public key.

   Authentication Secret IDs ('authSecID'):  _mandatory_

      In DAA, Authentication Secret IDs are represented by the DAA
      Issuer’s group public key that MUST be used to create DAA
      credentials for the corresponding Authentication Secrets used to
      protect Evidence.

      In DAA, an Authentication Secret ID does not identify a unique
      Attesting Environment but is associated with a group of Attesting
      Environments.  This is because an Attesting Environment should not
      be distinguishable and the DAA credential which represents the
      Attesting Environment is randomised each time it used.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   As outlined above, for DAA to provide privacy for the Attester, the
   DAA group must be large enough to stop the Verifier identifying the
   Attester.

   Randomisation of the DAA credential by the Attester means that
   collusion between the DAA Issuer and Verifier, will not give them any
   advantage when trying to identify the Attester.

   For DAA, the Attestation Evidence conveyed to the Verifier MUST not
   uniquely identify the Attester.  If the Attestation Evidence is
   unique to an Attester other cryptographic techniques can be used, for
   example, property based attestation [PBA].

7.  Security Considerations

   The anonymity property of DAA makes revocation difficult.  Well known
   solutions include:

   1.  Rogue Attester revocation -- if an Attester's private key is
       compromised and known by the Verifier then any DAA signature from
       that Attester can be revoked.

   2.  EPID - Intel's Enhanced Privacy ID -- this requires the Attester
       to prove (as part of their Attestation) that their credential was
       not used to generate any signature in a signature revocation
       list.

   There are no other special security considerations for DAA over and
   above those specified in the RATS architecture document
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].

8.  Implementation Considerations

   The new DAA Issuer role can be implemented in a number of ways, for
   example:

   1.  As a stand-alone service like a Certificate Authority, a Privacy
       CA.

   2.  As a part of the Attester's manufacture.  The Endorser and the
       DAA Issuer could be the same entity and the manufacturer would
       then provide a certificate for the group public key to the
       Verifier.

9.  IANA Considerations

   We don't yet.
